Setup
=====

Project
--------

- Create virtualenv 'arkanoid' using virtualenvwrapper:
    mkproject -p /usr/bin/python3 -f arkanoid

pygame
------
Install pygame in the virtual environment.
(see http://askubuntu.com/questions/299950/how-do-i-install-pygame-in-virtualenv)

- Install system-wide build dependencies (Ubuntu 14.04):
    sudo apt-get build-dep python-pygame
    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev

- Add pygame to the requirements.txt file:
    echo hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame >> requirements.txt

- Use pip to install the requirements:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The ball
--------

- I used the pygame tutorial http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/tom/MakeGames.html to understand how
a ball can be made to bounce around the screen. The behaviour in the tutorial is slightly different
(2 bats either side, rather than at bottom).

- I found I had to add some extra logic to handle the ball hitting the corner of the screen. In this
scenario using the tutorial's logic, the ball would disappear through a hole in the corner. The logic
I added was to detect when the ball was in the corner, and bounce it back in exactly the opposite
direction.
