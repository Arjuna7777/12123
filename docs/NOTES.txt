Setup
=====

Project
--------

- Install virtualenvwrapper by following the instructions
    https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Ensure you export the PROJECT_HOME environment variable to point at your workspace project folder

- Create virtualenv 'arkanoid' using virtualenvwrapper:
    mkproject -p /usr/bin/python3 -f arkanoid

pygame
------
Install pygame in the virtual environment.
(see http://askubuntu.com/questions/299950/how-do-i-install-pygame-in-virtualenv,
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17869101/unable-to-install-pygame-using-pip)

- Install system-wide build dependencies (Ubuntu 14.04):
    sudo apt-get build-dep python-pygame
    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
    
- Install system-wide build depedencies (Mac OSX):
    brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf smpeg portmidi 
    
- Install Mercurial (Mac OSX)
    brew install mercurial
    
- Clone the project out of GitHub and then run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The ball
--------

- I used the pygame tutorial http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/tom/MakeGames.html to understand how
a ball can be made to bounce around the screen. The behaviour in the tutorial is slightly different
(2 bats either side, rather than at bottom).

- I found I had to add some extra logic to handle the ball hitting the corner of the screen. In this
scenario using the tutorial's logic, the ball would disappear through a hole in the corner. The logic
I added was to detect when the ball was in the corner, and bounce it back in exactly the opposite
direction.

- Decided to refactor the Ball class and introduce the concept of a "collidable object". This
allows the Ball to not have to depend upon all the sorts of objects it needs to hit - such
as the paddle, blocks, sides, etc. Didn't want to go the route of the tutorial and use globals.
Callbacks better option, although bit more complex.

- trying desperately hard not to let the ball become a god object, with all logic encoded into it.
I want the objects the ball collides with to determine how the ball should bounce off them and at
what speed. I don't want the ball to have all this knowledge.

Restructring
------------

- The game has a fairly clean object model - the paddle, the ball, the bricks, the walls,
the powerups. Fully understanding how these objects interact and coming up with a flexible
object model that can accommodate it quite a challenge.

- Objects themselves and key functionality.

- Dealing with global objects such as the screen, clock, fonts etc. that need to be available
to all modules. Don't want to create circular module dependencies.

- Areas of difficulty - e.g. things that don't fit too cleanly into the model. For example,
the start sequence of the game, or when the game restarts after losing a life. Here, a series
of steps happen - which are still technically inside the game - but are outside of normal
gameplay.
