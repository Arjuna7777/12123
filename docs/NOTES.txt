Setup
=====

Project
--------

- Create virtualenv 'arkanoid' using virtualenvwrapper:
    mkproject -p /usr/bin/python3 -f arkanoid

pygame
------
Install pygame in the virtual environment.
(see http://askubuntu.com/questions/299950/how-do-i-install-pygame-in-virtualenv)

- Install system-wide build dependencies (Ubuntu 14.04):
    sudo apt-get build-dep python-pygame
    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev

- Add pygame to the requirements.txt file:
    echo hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame >> requirements.txt

- Use pip to install the requirements:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The ball
--------

- I used the pygame tutorial http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/tom/MakeGames.html to understand how
a ball can be made to bounce around the screen. The behaviour in the tutorial is slightly different
(2 bats either side, rather than at bottom).

- I found I had to add some extra logic to handle the ball hitting the corner of the screen. In this
scenario using the tutorial's logic, the ball would disappear through a hole in the corner. The logic
I added was to detect when the ball was in the corner, and bounce it back in exactly the opposite
direction.

- Decided to refactor the Ball class and introduce the concept of a "collidable object". This
allows the Ball to not have to depend upon all the sorts of objects it needs to hit - such
as the paddle, blocks, sides, etc. Didn't want to go the route of the tutorial and use globals.
Callbacks better option, although bit more complex.

- trying desperately hard not to let the ball become a god object, with all logic encoded into it.
I want the objects the ball collides with to determine how the ball should bounce off them and at
what speed. I don't want the ball to have all this knowledge.

Restructring
------------

- The game has a fairly clean object model - the paddle, the ball, the bricks, the walls,
the powerups. Fully understanding how these objects interact and coming up with a flexible
object model that can accommodate it quite a challenge.

- Objects themselves and key functionality.

- Dealing with global objects such as the screen, clock, fonts etc. that need to be available
to all modules. Don't want to create circular module dependencies.

- Areas of difficulty - e.g. things that don't fit too cleanly into the model. For example,
the start sequence of the game, or when the game restarts after losing a life. Here, a series
of steps happen - which are still technically inside the game - but are outside of normal
gameplay.

- Introduce concept of "Game Sequence" which is an object that implements a fixed series of
steps (such as game start/resume). When in play, these steps override the normal gameplay
until they have completed, after which the game resumes.

- Anchoring/releasing the ball.


Issues
------

- Logic for bouncing the ball according to standard trigonometry is buggy. Sometimes ball
gets stuck in strange pattern (e.g. when strikes top of left or right edge).

- Paddle overlaps side graphics.

- Need to implement some kind of speed factor in the ball bounce strategy

- Handle offscreen respawn.

- Fix key up issue stopping paddle movement.
