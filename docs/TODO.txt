ball will always gradually slow to base speed at pre-defined rate: x factor per frame (explain in Ball docstring)

_angle and _speed in ball should be public (not internal)

fix issue where ball gets stuck in wall/bricks

corner bouncing seems to increase speed on paddle/bricks

original game starts off with ball slow, but eventually ball moves at quicker pace generally.
split start_speed and base_speed
