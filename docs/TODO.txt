ball speed increase/decrease should be exponential rather than linear

ball will always gradually slow to base speed at pre-defined rate: x factor per frame (explain in Ball docstring)

_angle and _speed in ball should be public (not internal)

collisions should speed ball up and no collisions cause ball to slow over time

fix issue where ball gets stuck in wall/bricks


corner bouncing should only take effect when opposite corners are hit, so tr -> bl and tl -> br and br -> tl
otherwise normal top/bottom collision should take effect
