ball will always gradually slow to base speed at pre-defined rate: x factor per frame (explain in Ball docstring)


corner bouncing seems to increase speed on paddle/bricks

classes:


Multiple balls could be MultiBall() object switched out with game.ball.


The powerups should be more intelligent. Don't drop loads of the same when the powerup is already active?

Use Travis CI

The rounds should not hold a reference to the next rounds.
Round classes should be held in a list (or tuple) at the game level.
When a game is created, we create an "rounds = iter(ROUNDS)" attribute which we call next(rounds) on for each round.


2 regressions:
    - Ball getting stuck in side wall (side bounce bouncing the ball *back in*)
    - Can't switch between Laser -> Wide and vice versa
    - Left and right keys getting stuck down (if held down when game ends?)

Use DirtySprte and LayeredDirty and possibly sprite.collidesprite()
