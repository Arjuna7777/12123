ball will always gradually slow to base speed at pre-defined rate: x factor per frame (explain in Ball docstring)

_angle and _speed in ball should be public (not internal)

fix issue where ball gets stuck in wall/bricks

corner bouncing seems to increase speed on paddle/bricks

original game starts off with ball slow, but eventually ball moves at quicker pace generally.

bounce strategy should probably receive whole ball sprite, and whole collidable object (rect or whole sprite).
Then has opportunity to pick up other attributes, such as speed, and other state that might affect the bounce?
