bounce_strategy should return angle, speed

_angle and _speed in ball should be public (not internal)

collisions should speed ball up and no collisions cause ball to slow over time

rename on_collide to collide_action? This is different to bounce strategy in args/return and intent.

does ball hitting corner of object logic ever work?

fix issue where ball gets stuck in wall/bricks
