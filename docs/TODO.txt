ball will always gradually slow to base speed at pre-defined rate: x factor per frame (explain in Ball docstring)

_angle and _speed in ball should be public (not internal)

fix issue where ball gets stuck in wall/bricks

corner bouncing seems to increase speed on paddle/bricks

original game starts off with ball slow, but eventually ball moves at quicker pace generally.
split start_speed and base_speed

paddle needs to be predictable. remove randomness (this is provided by walls and bricks anyway).
reduce number of sections to 6

classes:

Arkanoid
    main class with main_loop

Game
    created when a game is started
    interacts and keeps track of current level, keeps track of number of lives, score
    has update() method called repeatedly by Arkanoid.main_loop()
    has attribute "over" which is checked by main_loop to determine whether to update or throw away
    if not game.over:
        game.update()

Round
    RoundOne
    RoundTwo
    etc.
    creates sprites, background, layout (may need base Round for common logic such as creating sprites - TemplatePattern here perhaps?)
    determines layout, keeps track of active power up
    brought into play when a person starts to play the game. ends when complete, or when lives fall below zero
    the Game keeps track of the Round
    has attribute "complete" which is checked by Game.update() to determine whether to move to next round
    if not round.complete:
        round.update()
    Game keeps track of lives. If lives < 0, then calls round.end() to notify Round to clean up.

PowerUp
    has activate() and deactivate() methods

LaserPaddle extends Paddle and is initialised with an instance of one
    assumes current state of existing paddle and changes image, extends with laser functionality
    laser bullets need to do collision detection with bricks (like ball does). bricks need not know about bullets.
