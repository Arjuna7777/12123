Arkanoid Remade
===============

I decided I would have a go at building a game using Python and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/), and I chose the 1980's arcade classic, Arkanoid.

I've always enjoyed breakout-type games which are satisfying and addictive to play, and Arkanoid with its varying brick layouts, powerups and enemies adds some extra fun and depth - to both gameplay and code design.

Being new to pygame, I started out by reading the tutorials, one of which helpfully uses Pong [as an example](http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/tom/MakeGames.html). This enabled me to get a headstart with the basic paddle and ball concepts which I was then able to build upon.

This implementation of Arkanoid is still work in progress, but the first 4 levels are fully functional. Check out the sequences below.
