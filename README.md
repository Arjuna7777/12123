My Arkanoid Clone
=================

This is my take of the '80s arcade classic Arkanoid, written in Python and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/).

I wanted to have a play with pygame, and since I've always enjoyed playing breakout-type games, I thought I'd try and have a go writing an Arkanoid clone.

One of the pygame tutorials uses Pong [as an example](http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/tom/MakeGames.html), which gave me a great head start.

The sequences below give an idea of how it looks. It's still work in progress as only rounds 1 - 4 are implemented.
